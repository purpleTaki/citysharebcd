# Welcome to the repository of City Share Bacolod, a product of the ITP211 Mobile Application Development course. 
This repository houses the APK for our revolutionary application, an innovative platform dedicated to the promotion of a free and communal exchange of goods within the vibrant city of Bacolod.
City Share Bacolod is a mobile application conceived in the spirit of Carousel, but with a distinct and unique approach. Unlike conventional buy-and-sell applications, City Share Bacolod focuses solely on the exchange of free items and promotes a culture of trade and barter.

## The Inspiration
Our inspiration, Carousel, has made a significant impact on the online marketplace by providing a seamless platform for buying and selling. We admired Carousel's commitment to facilitating community interaction and sought to take it a step further. City Share Bacolod is our attempt to foster a sharing economy, where the emphasis is not on the monetary value of goods, but on the act of giving, receiving, and swapping items within a community.

## The Concept
City Share Bacolod is an application designed to enable members of the Bacolod community to share items they no longer need and trade items they might find useful. This platform serves as a digital marketplace where users can upload items for free or barter trade, thereby promoting a sustainable and communal method of exchange.

## How it Works
City Share Bacolod is user-friendly and straightforward. Users can easily upload images and descriptions of items they wish to share or trade. Other users can then view these items and express interest by initiating a conversation about potential trade or simply thanking the user for their generosity.
